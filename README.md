# GridSearchCV
#### 🔍 Hyperparameter Tuning with GridSearchCV This project demonstrates how to optimize machine learning models using GridSearchCV, a powerful tool from scikit-learn for hyperparameter tuning.
#### 📊 Project Overview
##### Hyperparameter tuning is critical for improving model performance. In this project, GridSearchCV is used to systematically search through different parameter combinations to find the best settings for various algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM).

##### Key Steps:
- Define a parameter grid for each model

- Perform cross-validation using GridSearchCV

- Compare model performance before and after tuning

- Visualize results and evaluate best parameters

##### ⚙️ Tools & Libraries
- Python

- scikit-learn

- pandas, NumPy

- seaborn, matplotlib

#### 🎯 Outcome
By the end of this project, you’ll see how hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV helps improve accuracy, reduce overfitting, and produce more reliable machine learning models.
